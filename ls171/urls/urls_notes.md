## Be able to identify the components of a URL, including query strings

3:4 **<u>HTTP Book: What is a URL?</u>**

**<u>URL Components</u>**

* **scheme** -- comes before the colon and two forward slashes and tells the web client how to access the resource, e.g. `http`
* **host** -- where the resource is hosted or located, e.g. a domain name like `www.google.com`
* **port** -- the TCP port number, only needed if you want to use a port other than the default
* **path** -- shows what local (to the given host) resource is being requested
* **query string** -- used to send data to the server
  * **query parameters**

The non-optional parts of a URL are **scheme** and **host**. Obviously modern web browser can often find the right scheme if we only type in the host, but the browser must fill in the missing scheme, in a similar way to adding the default port.

**<u>Query Strings/Query Parameters</u>**

* Parts of a query string:

  * `?` -- reserved character that marks the start of the query string

  * `this=that` -- a query parameter name/value pair

  * `&` -- query string separator, a reserved character used when adding more query parameter key/value pairs to the query string

* How the server uses query parameters is up to the server side application.

* Because query strings are passed in through the URL, they are ordinarily only used in HTTP GET requests
  * POST requests do allow query strings, but it is relatively uncommon and shouldn't be used with any info you would not want logged somewhere
* Whenever you type in a URL into the address bar of your browser, you're issuing HTTP GET requests

* Query strings are great to pass in additional information to the server, but there are limits to the use of query strings
  * Query strings have a maximum length. Therefore, if you have a lot of data to pass on, you will not be able to do so with query strings
  * The name/value pairs used in query strings are visible in the URL. For this reason, passing sensitive information like username or password to the server in this manner is not recommended
  * Space and special characters like `&` cannot be used with query strings. They must be URL encoded



3:6: **<u>URLs</u>**

* The concept of a URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier, was one of the fundamental elements in Berners-Lee's initial concept of the Web
* URLs are the most commonly used part of the general concept of a URI
* The distinction between the two terms URL and URI is a common cause of confusion and contention
* The terms are often used interchangeably
* According to RFC3986, a URI is a "sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource", and a URL refers to "the subset of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network 'location')"
* A URL is a subset of URI that includes the network location of the resource
* For our purposes, we don't need to pour over the relevant RFCs and W3C standards
  * In HTTP, we are dealing with URLs, but it isn't incorrect to call them URIs

**Schemes and Protocols**

* Another point of confusion are the terms 'scheme' and 'protocol'
* In the context of URL components, the component that precedes the `://` is called the **scheme**
* In the context of a URL, there is a relationship between the scheme and the protocol used to access the resource but they are not the same thing
  * In the context of a URL, the scheme identifies which family of protocols should be used to access the resource, e.g. `http://` means we can use the HTTP family but is not specific about the specific protocol version, e.g. `HTTP/1.1`
  * In the more general or abstract context of a URI, a scheme name is defined as "a specification for assigning identifiers within that scheme" and needn't be related to a communication protocol at all (so in this case, the `http` scheme name refers to a set of rules for assigning unique identifiers within the `http` scheme, and the fact that this scheme relates to the HTTP family of protocols is incidental -- some other schemes have no connection to network communications or locations at all)
* The canonical form of a scheme name is lower case, e.g. `http`
  * The canonical form of protocols tends to be upper case, e.g. `HTTP`

**URLs and Filepaths**

* The concept of a URL was derived to a large extent from the combination of domain names, which already existed when Berners-Lee conceived of the Web, and Unix-style file paths
  * At this point, the intention of the web was to provide access to static HTML file
  * In the early days, the **path** portion of a URL represented a physical file location on the web server's filesystem
  * So a URL such as `http://www.mywebsite.com/food/recipes/lasagne.html` could be used to request the `lasagne.html` file from the `recipes` directory under the `food` directory on the web server identified by `www.mywebsite.com`
* Today, much of the content on the web is generated dynamically
  * The way the path component of the URL is used or interpreted depends on the application logic, and doesn't necessarily bear any relationship to an underlying file structure on the server
  * Often the use of the path component involves URL pattern-matching to match the path to a pre-defined '**route**' which then executes some specific logic

3:9 **<u>Summary</u>**

* A URI is an identifier for a particular resource within an information space
* A URL is a subset of URI, but the two terms are often used interchangeably
* URL components include the scheme, host (or hostname), port, path, and query string
* Query strings are used to pass additional data to the server during an HTTP Request. They take the form of name/value pairs separated by and `=` sign. Multiple name/value pairs are separated by an `&` sign. The start of the query string is indicated by a `?`

## Have an understanding of what URL encoding is and when it might be used

3:4 **<u>HTTP book: What is a URL?</u>**

**<u>URL Encoding</u>**

* URLs are designed to accept only certain characters in the standard 128-character ASCII character set
* Reserved or unsafe ASCII characters that are not being used for their intended purpose, as well as characters not in the US-ASCII set, have to be encoded
* URL encoding serves the purpose of replacing these non-conforming characters with a `%` symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the equivalent UTF-8 character
* Each byte in a UTF-8 codepoint gets represented with another `%` followed by the next two hexadecimal digits, e.g. a `¬£` character becomes `%C2%A3`. Since UTF-8 can be up to four bytes, we can have four `%FF` byte representations together representing a single UTF-8 character, e.g. the character `êçà` is represented as `%F0%90%8D%88`
* All UTF-8 characters in the extended ASCII character set have single byte UTF-8 codes
* Characters **must** be encoded if
  * They have no corresponding character within the standard ASCII character set. This includes all extended ASCII characters, and all UTF-8 characters that have 2-, 3-, and 4-byte UTF-8 codes
  * The use of the character is unsafe since it may be misinterpreted or modified by some systems. For example, `%` is unsafe since it is used to encode other characters. Other unsafe characters include spaces, quotation marks, the `#` character, `<` and `>`, `{` and `}`, `[` and `]`, and `~`, among others
  * The character is reserved for special use within the URL scheme. Some characters are reserved for a special meaning; their presence in a URL serves a specific purpose. Characters such as `/`, `?`, `:`, `@`, and `&` are all reserved and must be encoded. For example `&` is reserved for use as a query string delimiter. `:` is also reserved to delimit host/port components and user/password
* The only characters that do not need to be encoded are
  * Alphanumeric characters and the characters `$ - _ . + ! ' ( ) " ,` [I'm aware that above it says quotation marks *do* need to be encoded! Quotes are considered unsafe in an HTML context, when the `href` URL is enclosed in quotes, so they should be encoded as well]
  * Reserved characters when used for their special purpose. If they are not being used for their reserved purpose, they must be encoded



From Wikipedia 'Percent-encoding':

* URL encoding, officially known as **percent-encoding**, is a method to encode arbitrary data in a URI
* Only US-ASCII characters are legal in a URI
* The characters allowed in a URI are either *reserved* or *unreserved* (or a percent character as part of a percent-encoding)
  * Reserved characters sometimes or always have a special meaning, e.g. a `/` character separates different parts of a path in a URL
    * Exactly which characters have special meanings partly depends on the scheme, and has also changed as the URI spec has been revised over the years
  * Unreserved characters have no such meanings
* Using percent-encoding, reserved characters are represented using special character sequences
  * We convert the character to its numeric code in US-ASCII hexadecimal representation and if it is a single digit we must add a leading `0`
  * This number is then prefixed with `%`
  * So, e.g., `/` becomes `%2F` or `%2f` (either case will work but upper case is preferred by W3C)

3:9 **<u>Summary</u>**

* URL encoding is a technique whereby certain characters in a URL are replaced with a `%` symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the characters ASCII value
* URL encoding is used if a character has no corresponding character in the ASCII set, is unsafe because it is used for encoding other characters [i.e. `%`], or is reserved for special use within URLs
